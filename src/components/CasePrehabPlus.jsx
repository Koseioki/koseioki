                Patients already receive a lot of paperwork, and most cancer patients are older adults who may have limited experience with technology.

                            First I conducted generative research (“What’s up with…?) online, exploring the broader context of colorectal cancer treatment through online sources, to gather foundational knowledge about the disease and its associated care.

                        <p className="paragraph">
                            According to Cancer Research UK, Typical prehabilitation includes three lifestyle changes: nutrition, exercise, and psycho-behavioural support.

                            Physical activity is a crucial part of the prehabilitation process, as it not only improves overall physical functioning but also helps reduce anxiety and depression, increases energy levels, and can stimulate appetite.

                            At Region Sjælland, after a colorectal cancer diagnosis, the medical team conducts all necessary examinations before holding a multidisciplinary team (MDT) conference.

                        <p className="paragraph">
                            During this conference, healthcare professionals assess the patient’s condition and assign a risk category—A, B, C, or D. This classification is then directly used to determine which prehabilitation programme the patient will follow.

                            The program’s content varies based on the patient’s classification. Patients in categories A, B, and C1 undergo a two-week prehabilitation period, while those in categories C2 and D follow a four-week program.
                        </p>
                        <p className="paragraph">
                            For example, patients in category A typically require only iron infusions during their two-week period, whereas category D patients follow a more comprehensive plan that includes supervised and unsupervised physical training, protein supplementation, consultations, assessments, and other interventions.

                            Supervised and home training sessions are scheduled regularly, as the prehabilitation facilitator needs to coordinate with physiotherapists in advance. In contrast, other appointments can be arranged more flexibly, depending on the patient’s condition.

                            Before starting any visual design work, I created a user flow based on the list of requirements, to structure how users would navigate the solution in order to complete their tasks.

                            Based on the sketches and user flow, I then created a Lo-Fi prototype in Figma with less emphasis on visual aesthetics, since it will be easier for me to modify after finding flaws in the flow during usability testing afterwards.

                        <p className="paragraph">
                            I applied the Law of Proximity to the list items, as visually grouped elements are perceived as related. This helps users easily understand that these items serve similar functions.

                            I created a moodboard to better understand the overall visual style.

                            I then conducted usability testing sessions on the Lo-Fi prototype to ensure that the functions are working as I intend. During the test, I followed the “Think-Aloud” method to understand where testers are struggling to find information and what is causing confusion. I used this testing method because, according to Norman Nielsen Group, it is cost-effective and easy to learn.

I aimed to involve a diverse group of users, since the research shows that cancer patients have varying abilities.

                            The exercise tutorial page includes both a video and a text-based tutorial. According to WCAG, all non-text content presented to users must have a text alternative that serves an equivalent purpose (Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content)

                            On the calendar page, I avoided using colour as the sole indicator for the type of appointments, in accordance with WCAG, which states that color must not be used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element (Success Criterion 1.4.1: Use of Color).

                        </p>

                        <p className="paragraph">
                            I used a heading in each section in accordance with WCAG Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships, as screen reader users often navigate pages by headings to understand the structure and quickly locate relevant content.

                        </p>
                        <img src={PrehabPlusA11y4} alt="" aria-hidden="true" />
                        <p className="paragraph">
                            However, this introduced a problem: in this example, since the DOM order is checkbox → heading → time → button, when a screen reader focuses on the heading, it might miss the checkbox, as the checkbox is not programmatically associated with the heading.

                        </p>
                        <img src={PrehabPlusA11y5} alt="" aria-hidden="true" />

                        <p className="paragraph">
                            To resolve this, I inserted an invisible heading before the checkbox and applied aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; to the visible heading. This ensures that screen readers recognise only the hidden heading, placing the checkbox under it in the accessibility tree, while the visible heading remains available for sighted users.

                        <p className="paragraph">
                            I implemented a bypass block in the form of a “Skip to main content” link within the navigation. This allows keyboard users and users of assistive technologies to quickly jump to the main content without having to tab through the entire navigation each time. This improves usability and supports accessibility best practices (Success Criterion 2.4.1: Bypass Blocks).

                        <p className="paragraph">
                            I added visible focus indicators to all interactive elements to ensure that keyboard users can clearly identify which element is currently focused. This aligns with Success Criterion 2.4.7: Focus Visible.

                        </p>
                        <p className="paragraph">
                            Additionally, I ensured that the focus indicators meet sufficient colour contrast requirements against both the element and the background in all possible combinations, improving visibility and accessibility for users with low vision.

                        <img src={PrehabPlusA11y7} alt="" aria-hidden="true" />

                            I added aria-labels to the link buttons in the to-do list, including the specific name of each exercise (Success Criterion 2.4.4: Link Purpose (In Context)).

                        <p className="paragraph">
                            This ensures that screen reader users—who may navigate using a list of links—receive meaningful context instead of repetitive and uninformative text like “Se vejledning, Se vejledning, Se vejledning…”.

                            Since this application is built in React, navigating between pages can sometimes result in the focus landing in the middle of the page, which may disorient users—especially those relying on screen readers or keyboard navigation.

                        </p>
                        <p className="paragraph">
                            To address this, I implemented a function that automatically sets focus to the &lt;h1&gt; heading when a user navigates to a new page.

                        <p className="paragraph">
                            To make the &lt;h1&gt; focusable without adding it to the tab order, I used tabIndex={-1}. This enables programmatic focus while preventing users from reaching the element through normal tab navigation.

                        </p>

                            I ensured that the list/calendar view toggle is fully operable for screen reader users. To support WCAG Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships, I included a visually hidden heading labelled “Skift visning”, allowing screen reader users to easily locate the section.

                        </p>
                        <p className="paragraph">
                            The toggle button itself is assigned role=&quot;switch&quot; and aria-label=&quot;Skift visning&quot;, enabling screen readers to accurately convey the function and purpose of the control.

                        </p>
                        <p className="paragraph">
                            To inform users of the current state after interaction, I implemented an invisible aria-live region directly below the toggle.

                            This region dynamically announces which view is currently selected once the toggle is activated. By setting aria-live=&quot;polite&quot;, the screen reader announces the change without interrupting the user’s current task.
